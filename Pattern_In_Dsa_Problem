Beyond system design, coding interviews remain a crucial part of the technical interview process at top tech companies. Here are the most important coding patterns and questions trending in 2025 interviews:

## High-ROI Coding Patterns for 2025

Focusing on these patterns will give you the highest return on investment for your interview preparation:

### 1. Two Pointers Technique

**Applications**: Arrays, strings, linked lists
**Key Problems**:
- Two Sum variations (three sum, four sum)
- Container With Most Water
- Trapping Rain Water
- Palindrome verification
- Removing duplicates

**Example 2025 Question**:
```
Design an algorithm to find all unique quadruplets in an array that sum to a target, with O(nÂ³) time complexity and optimized space usage.
```

### 2. Sliding Window

**Applications**: Arrays, strings, hash tables
**Key Problems**:
- Maximum sum subarray of size K
- Longest substring with K distinct characters
- Minimum window substring
- Longest substring without repeating characters

**Example 2025 Question**:
```
Given a string and a pattern, find all start indices of pattern's anagrams in the string with optimal time and space complexity.
```

### 3. Tree & Graph Traversals (DFS/BFS)

**Applications**: Binary trees, graphs, matrices
**Key Problems**:
- Path sum variations
- Binary tree level order traversal
- Course schedule (topological sort)
- Number of islands
- Word ladder

**Example 2025 Question**:
```
Design an algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph where weights represent time, but some edges can only be traversed during specific time windows.
```

### 4. Binary Search Variations

**Applications**: Sorted arrays, search space reduction
**Key Problems**:
- Search in rotated sorted array
- Find first and last position of element
- Median of two sorted arrays
- Kth smallest element in a sorted matrix

**Example 2025 Question**:
```
Design an algorithm to find the kth smallest element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted 2D array with optimal time complexity.
```

### 5. Dynamic Programming with Optimizations

**Applications**: Optimization problems, counting problems
**Key Problems**:
- Longest increasing subsequence
- Edit distance
- Coin change
- Unique paths
- Knapsack problem variants

**Example 2025 Question**:
```
Implement a space-optimized solution for the minimum cost to cut a rod into pieces of specific lengths, where each cut has a different cost.
```

### 6. Graph Algorithms (Advanced)

**Applications**: Social networks, routing, scheduling
**Key Problems**:
- Network delay time
- Minimum spanning tree
- Strongly connected components
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford)

**Example 2025 Question**:
```
Design an algorithm to find the most efficient way to connect multiple servers where connection costs vary based on data transfer rates and physical distance.
```

### 7. Interval Merging and Processing

**Applications**: Calendar scheduling, resource allocation
**Key Problems**:
- Merge intervals
- Insert interval
- Meeting rooms
- Non-overlapping intervals
